# love-percentage
this is simple love percentage application in javascript

Hello everyone this is a simple love percentage calculator webapp.

How it works:

first it will ask you to enter your name and then a new screen will appear.
now you have to put the name of person that you want to see how much he/she love's you
and it will tell you in percentages

i used https://rapidapi.com/ajith/api/love-calculator api for that.

it was a fun project for me ,you can see live preview https://affectionate-morse-1017bd.netlify.com/

Thank you very much 

suggestion or any improvement are must appreciated
